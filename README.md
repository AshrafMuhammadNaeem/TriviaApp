Use of Span tag:
The <span> tag is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document.

The <span> tag is easily styled by CSS or manipulated with JavaScript using the class or id attribute.

The <span> tag is much like the <div> element, but <div> is a block-level element and <span> is an inline element.

Use of div Tag:
The <div> tag defines a division or a section in an HTML document.

The <div> tag is used as a container for HTML elements - which is then styled with CSS or manipulated with JavaScript.

Any sort of content can be put inside the <div> tag! 

Use of footer Tag:
The <footer> tag defines a footer for a document or section.

A <footer> element typically contains:

    related documents

You can have several <footer> elements in one document.

JSON.stringy and parse difference:
stringify means, take an object and return its presentation as a string. What you have, is already a string and not a JSON object.

The opposite is JSON.parse which takes a string and turns it into an object.
